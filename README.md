Analyze Indian markets with R

Most DIY quants find it difficult to subscribe to Indian market data, set up a database, jobs to download, etc. If you are a hobbyist programmer, you shouldn't be rquired to go through all this before you even get started.

StockViz will now start making most of our internal data accessible to programmeres through APIs. Here's how it works:

1) Data will remain within the confines of StockViz - there is no "shipping" of data.
2) Programmers do what they do best - write code. We will pull to code onto our servers and run them. The output should be piped to files in the "report" folder.
3) Both code and output will be public.
